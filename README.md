# InversionCounter
Implement the Sort-and-Count divide-and-conquer algorithm as a recursive function. Including the sub problem of merge-and-count. 
The program should prompts for an input file name, and then reads from the file a list of array elements one line at a time 
and display on the screen the number of inversions in the array and the sorted array elements.
